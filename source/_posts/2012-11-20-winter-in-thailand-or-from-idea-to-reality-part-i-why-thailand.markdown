# Introduction

I want to write several articles about living Thailand. Of course a lot of people have been there, so my articles could look a little trite, but, on the other hand - why not? May be my experience will be useful for somebody.

# About remote work and living in foreign countries

Many of remote workers can easily work everywhere if there's an fair internet connection. If you like to travel - mix travel and work look like a very attractive idea. 

When you are on usual holiday you hardly learn a lot about foreign country during those two weeks. But if you live and work in there for several month - Oh you can tell a lot about it.

Also different places of world have different features, may be you'll like some of them.

# Why Thailand?

I like weather to be warm. I like sea, fruits and learning foreign languages. Also I'm a remote worker, so I need fair internet connection.

As winter begin to come - I thought, may be it'd be great to move to some warm place? I'm not rich DevOp from Ukraine so this place should have not very big prices.

So after some comparision and reading different sources I choose Thailand. How it looks from internet?

Pros:

  * it's cheap to live here, about the same prices as living costs in Ukraine.
  * A lot of tasty and fresh fruits, vegetables and seafood.
  * Sea available
  * It's warm here, no winter at all
  * Crime rates are low, people are friendly and positive.
  * Internet is good, mostly ADSL as wired connection and also there's a several 3G operators with good coverage.

Cons:

  * A lot of insects here
  * It's a little too hot here
  * a few people in Thailand speak english, you will need to learn Thai to have full living experience here.

Running ahead, I should tell that all these stuff appear to be true, when I've come to Thailand.

It looks good for me - so I choose Thailand, that lead me to next step - I needed to buy airtickets to Thailand.
