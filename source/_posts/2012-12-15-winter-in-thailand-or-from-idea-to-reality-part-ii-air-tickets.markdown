# Intro

So we need to buy air tickets to Thailand. After some thoughts we decide to buy air tickets to Bagkok, spent there several days, and then move to Ko Samui.

<!-- more -->

# Where to find cheapest ones?

I doubt that I'll say something new, but earlier you buy tickets - the cheaper they will get.
Because:

  * most cheap tickets end up first.
  * most companies give you discount if you buy tickets in advance.

We use [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) to search for cheapest tickets. We bought tickets not early, so they cost us a lot - 900$ per person from Ukraine to Thailand and back.

After we found tickets on [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/), [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) provide us choice of sites where we can book them.

We choose [Orbitz](http://www.orbitz.com/). it was good choice. [Orbitz](http://www.orbitz.com/) worked very well, there wasn't any problems.

We bought tickets from Austrian Airways from Khrakov to Bangkok with one connection in Vienna.

Flight from Kharkov to Vienna was very good. Flight from Vienna to Bangkok in Boing 777 wasn't so comfortable. They have very small chairs in those Boing 777 :) 

# Running a few step forward.

Later we use [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) again to search for and book tickets to Ko Samui from Bangkok. There was a lot of problems with booking tickets with [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/). so I don't recommend to book tickets with [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) itself, use it only for searching.

Problems was:

  * They confirm booking
  * HOLD money on creditcard
  * Then canceled booking
  * Money on creditcard stayed on HOLD for 30 days

I especially don't like the last point.

I booked tickets that [KAYAK](https://www.kayak.com/) cannot book for me on site of air company that make flight - it was [Bangkok Airways](http://www.bangkokair.com/eng), there wasn't any problems.
