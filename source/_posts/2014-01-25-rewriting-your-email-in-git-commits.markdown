Sometimes you need to rewrite your email in your commits in some git repository.
Do it with command:

    git filter-branch --env-filter 'if [ $GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL = bad@email ]; then GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=correct@email; fi; export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL'

For your collaborators this operatioin might be dangerous. According to [Jakub NarÄ™bski](http://stackoverflow.com/users/46058/jakub-narebski) collaborators will need to:

* if they didn't base their work on history pre-rewrite, just `git reset --hard origin/master` or just `git pull origin` (which should fast-forward). 
* If they based their change, they have to rebase using `git rebase origin/master` or just `git pull --rebase origin`
