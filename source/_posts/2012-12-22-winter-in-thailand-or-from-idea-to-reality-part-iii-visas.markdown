# Intro

We have air tickets to Thailand now, but that's not all. Now we need visas to Thailand. 

I will tell about visas for Ukrainian citizens.

# Types of Thailand visas for Ukrainians

* Visa on arrival, 15 days: you can get it in the airport. Sometimes you can be asked to prove that you have enough money and have air ticket from Thailand.
* Single entry tourist visa, 2 monthes + can be prolong for 1 month for 1900 Baht: You need to process it in advance.
* Double entry tourist visa, 2+1 monthes, fly out of Thailand, fly back and then again 2+1 monthes.: You need to process it in advance.
* Business visa: about 1 year, I don't look into this visa a lot becasue you need to have some buisness in Thailand.
* Education visa: about 1 year, Nod bad, but you need to learn something in Thailand and pay money to some Thailand's educational institution.

# Which visa to choose?

* Visa to arrival? definitely no, we need to stay for several monthes.
* Tourist visa? Sounds good.
* Buisness visa? I haven't buisness in Thailand and don't plan to create one.
* Education visa? not bad, but more expensive than tourist visa (from 20000 Baht per year). And of course you will need spend time for learning.

So after some thoughts I chose double entry tourist's visa.

# Processing a visa

We do a little trick for proccess Thailand visa easier - we outsource this work to Travel Agency :) 
Of course each visa cost more for us(170$ instead of 90$), but it saved us a lot of time and brain cells.

Also Travel Agency help us with processing medical insurrance for Thailand, it costs us about 150$ per person. 

We provided following documents to process visas:
- Foreign passport
- Reference about your bank account state (you need to have more than 600$ on your bank account)
- Preinted air tickets
- Insurance vouchers
- Reference from work that we have work place in Ukraine
- two 3x4 cm photos

We gave these documents to travel agency and in a week have our foreign passports with visas back.
